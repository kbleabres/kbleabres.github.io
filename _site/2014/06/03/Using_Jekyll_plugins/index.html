    <h1>On using Jekyll, and plugins</h1>
    <h5>03 June 2014 </h5>
    <p>
      <p>It's only been a few weeks since I first started to get familiarized with <em>Ruby on Rails</em>, and almost everything related to it, like <em>Github!</em> Where you can store your open source project code. I found out about <em>Jekyll</em> after stumbling upon a lot of blogs about Rails. Jekyll is used to build static websites that can run on Github pages.</p>

<p>Now this, <a href="https://kbleabres.github.io">kbleabres.github.io</a>, is using Jekyll and surprisingly, I am enjoying Jekyll. Surprisingly because, despite the fact that most people think this is less work than other kind of blogs, I personally think this requires a lot more work. Create a new post. Add front matter <em>(though I handled this already via Rakefile.)</em> Save. Then <code>git add .</code> <code>git commit -m "New blog post"</code> <code>git push -u origin master</code>  rathen than a simple Click text, type your blog, Post. Yes, I am talking about <em>Tumblr</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, I wanted my site to look a little better everyday. Or at least every week. But ever since I started using Jekyll, I have been avoiding posts about using plugins because I wanted my website to be as simple as possible. For me: <em>Plugins</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>more features</em> <strong>=</strong> <em>more things to maintain and handle.</em> So basically, adding plugins means adding more work. It's tiring.</p>

<p>And I was right. I didn't know what changed my mind. Maybe because I have seen a lot of blogs that have this feature and I wanted it for my own blog too. It's the "reading time" stuff. Where it will tell you about how much of your time will be spent reading a post. It's quite cool if you ask me.</p>

<p>So yeah, I decided to add a plugin to my Jekyll blog. And it was working perfectly while I was viewing it via <code>localhost:4000</code> so I continued typing my blog post and after, I pushed to my repo. When I viewed my site online.. <strong>oh my god the horror</strong></p>

<p>Then I found out that GitHub renders pages with safe mode enabled. Therefore, my custom plugin was disabled because it was a third party plugin.</p>

<p>I then asked Google how to make these plugins work. I followed a set of instructions that told me to rename my current directory to <code>something</code> and create a new directory named <code>something_something</code> and copy the contents of <code>something</code> to <code>something_something</code> and <code>git rm -r</code> my <code>something</code> directory. After that, it made me do <code>jekyll build</code> on <code>something_something</code> and then made me copy the contents of <code>something_something</code> to <code>something</code> and then create a <code>.nojekyll</code> file in the <code>something</code> directory. Then <code>git add --all :/</code> <code>git commit -m "Built site locally"</code> (because this set of steps is making you build your site locally) and finally <code>git push -u origin master</code></p>

<p>After following that set of instructions <strong>oh god the horror x 10000</strong></p>

<caption align="bottom"><em>THE HORROR</em></caption>

</table>


<div class="clear">&nbsp;</div>


<p>My website looked a lot more worse than before I did those set of steps. Basically, the layout was stripped out of my blog and the tags weren't working anymore. I was pretty sure I followed the instructions very well. I was sure.</p>

<p>So I just undid my push, and looked for another set of instructions. Now this one doesn't make me do anything other than pasting a long block of code into my <code>Rakefile</code> and then running <code>rake blog:publish</code>. I hoped that this would work but an error about permission was appearing. I asked Google yet again but there were no answers fit for my problem.</p>

<p>So I searched and searched and I stumbled upon <a href="http://ixti.net/software/2013/01/28/using-jekyll-plugins-on-github-pages.html">ixti's solution</a> and it worked like a charm omg the best thing that happened to me today</p>

<p>So basically all I have to do was to put this on my <code>Rakefile</code></p>

<pre><code>require "tmpdir"
require "bundler/setup"
require "jekyll"

GITHUB_REPONAME = "kbleabres/kbleabres.github.io"

desc "Generate blog files"
task :generate do
    Jekyll::Site.new(Jekyll.configuration({
        "source"      =&gt; ".",
        "destination" =&gt; "_site"
    })).process
end

desc "Generate and publish blog to gh-pages"
task :publish =&gt; [:generate] do
    Dir.mktmpdir do |tmp|
        cp_r "_site/.", tmp

        pwd = Dir.pwd
        Dir.chdir tmp

        system "git init"
        system "git add ."
        message = "Site updated at #{Time.now.utc}"
        system "git commit -m #{message.inspect}"
        system "git remote add origin git@github.com:#{GITHUB_REPONAME}.git"
        system "git push origin master --force"

    Dir.chdir pwd
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>and all I had to do next was to run <code>rake publish</code> and when I viewed my site wow it was back to normal, with the feature I wanted!!</p>

<p>Cooleo</p>
