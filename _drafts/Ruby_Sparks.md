The end of my summer vacation is nearing, and the end of our summer internship is coming twice as fast. We're already on our 7th and last week here at **ÆLOGICA** and I'm sure we have learned so much in just one and a half months. 

During our internship, we are to experience developing web applications using Ruby on Rails. *Ruby on Rails*, or simply Rails, is a web development framework running on the Ruby programming language, something I have never used before. We were to contribute features to open source projects like Gitlab and Discourse. Almost everything was new to me. 

I started learning by reading and following tutorials available online. Most of the links were given to us by the developers here at **AELOGICA**. They lend a hand whenever you needed help (and whenever they weren't busy with their own projects.) The difference between the school and the work place is that no one is actually telling you how to do things. You have to discover things on your own. You do it the way you feel comfortable (but also keeping in mind the requirements given by the client, or conforming to the format of the codebase you're contributing to.) Unlike in school, where the professor introduces the stuff to you and then they give you examples to practice on. At work, you start with the "practice" and that's how you get introduced to the stuff you have to learn. 

There were a lot of tutorials and articles online that helped me with learning Rails. Other articles said that I didn't have to learn Ruby (the programming language Rails is running on) to learn Rails. Others said I should learn Ruby first. I did the latter. Learning Ruby and Rails was a bit hard, but also kind of easy. It was hard because like I said, I have never used them before so I had to figure out how to do things as I progress. But it is easy because basically, most programming languages have similar syntax. I liked Java a lot before, but typing `puts 'Hi'` rather than `System.out.println("Hi");` just to say "Hi" and typing `5.times { puts "Hi" }` instead of `for(i=0; i<5; i++) { System.out.println("Hi"); }` just to say "Hi" 5 times is a lot more efficient. And that's what Ruby offers: simplicity and productivity in object-oriented programming.

Learning how to use Rails means understanding the *MVC pattern or the Model-View-Controller pattern.* Working on the open source project helped me understand this. But I know I need more practice to master this. 

Before actually contributing to an open source project, I first started working on the internals of **AELOGICA**. I helped Ricky make a Brand book for **AELOGICA**. I thought I already know a lot about Photoshop, but working on this project made me learn a lot more. I figured that there were steps I used to do before that can be done in an easier manner. 

Design. It is fundamental in any thing you see in this world, not just in applications. Being creative is also a skill any developer should have. Working on the project helped me become more creative. I think it also helped me code more beautifully than before. 

After about a week working on the project, our supervisor, Nestor, provided us a list of open source projects we can contribute to.

Karlo, **AELOGICA**'s only intern last year (who's now a developer here), contributed to *Gitlab*. He implemented a version of Github's contributors graph for Gitlab. 

> Skills learned
> + Learned the fundamentals of an object-oriented programming language
> + Enhanced front-end skills by building functional web applications using Raols
> + Use UNIX commands 
> + use Ruby shell (interactive ruby) to execute code scripts
> + git basics
> + git add, git commit, git fetch, git pull, git push
> + hashes and arrays
> + conditional logic
> + writing and calling methods
> + deploying web app using Heroku
> + refactor
> + pair programming -  when two people work together on a feature, this helps them both improve their skills. 
> + code review, pull requests - excellent feature that help experienced developers sharetheir knowledge with juniors and, at the same time, make sure that the production code remains high quality
