The end of my summer vacation is nearing, and the same goes for my summer internship. I'm already on my last week as an intern here at Ã†LOGICA. 

During our internship, we are expected to experience developing web applications using Ruby on Rails. We were to contribute features to open source projects like Gitlab and Discourse. 
During these six weeks you will:
 - experience all aspects of development using the in-demand Ruby on Rails web development framework.
 - choose and implement features for one or more an open source projects
 - create pull requests and hopefully get your code accepted by the project maintainers
 - learn to deploy and automatically test web applications
 - experience pair programming with AELOGICA developers on internal or client projects
