So, I just decided to "update" my Jekyll blog which I created when I was just starting to fumble with Ruby on Rails.
I wonder, what should I do with this? Should I keep updating this and just use this as my blog?
But I already have a new domain at [leabres.kim](https://leabres.kim) and I was planning to set up blog right there.
I'm not really sure yet. And I don't have anything else to say.

Bye!
